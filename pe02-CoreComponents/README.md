# Input

The application starts by receiving user inputs through the UI elements created with React Native core components. For instance, users can press buttons, input text, or move between screens using tab-based navigation. These actions act as inputs to activate certain logic or show components. 

# Procedure 

When input is received, the program handles the data through state management (using `useState`) and conditional rendering. Elements adjust in real-time according to user interactions. The logic is organized modularly in the `app/` directory, with essential files like `App.js` and `_layout.tsx` managing navigation and rendering. Data modifications and element updates happen according to specified functions and events initiated by users. 

# Output

The ultimate result is the displayed user interface seen by the user. This encompasses revised perspectives, textual presentations, and visuals based on the inputs received. The app operates in real-time, visually showcasing changes to assist and actively involve the user.
