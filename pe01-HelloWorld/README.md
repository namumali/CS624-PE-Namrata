# Input
The program takes no user-generated input. Instead, it uses static data embedded in the source code. This includes the user's name, degree program, and school, all hardcoded within the React Native components. The app also uses built-in libraries such as react-native, expo, and StyleSheet to structure and style the interface.

# Process
The app initializes by rendering a single View component containing three Text components. The StyleSheet is used to define a consistent yellow background for the View and to apply styling such as padding and font size. When the app loads, the React Native engine compiles the components and applies styles accordingly, displaying the static data with a smooth, mobile-friendly layout using Expo.

# Output
The output is a mobile user interface screen that shows the userâ€™s name, degree program, and school. This text is displayed in a clean layout on a yellow background, following the assignment constraints.
