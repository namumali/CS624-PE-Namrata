# Input

The application receives input from the user through a text field in a React Native program. The entered text signifies a new task to be done. When the user types, the inputChange() function is activated, updating the inputValue state with this.setState({inputValue}). This guarantees the input field stays aligned with the component's state. 

# Procedure 

When the user presses the button to include a to-do, a new entry is added to the todos array in the component’s state through this.setState(). Every to-do task is saved as a string within the array. A log message verifies the input and successful inclusion. The component utilizes ScrollView for managing scrolling and layout, along with React Native’s props system to convey state values and handler functions to its child components. 

# Output

The application dynamically generates the list of tasks to be completed. Every new entry is recorded and appended to the list, which refreshes the UI instantly.
